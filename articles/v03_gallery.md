## Example 1: Spatial autocorrelation of economic activity in South Korea

### Design idea

In this example, we use Moran’s *I* statistics to analyze the spatial
distribution of economic activity (measured by the number of registered
companies) across South Korea in 2020.

- Global Moran’s I evaluates whether there is overall spatial
  autocorrelation, i.e., whether areas with similar company counts tend
  to cluster together nationwide.
- Local Moran’s I (LISA) identifies local clusters and outliers by
  classifying each district into four types:
  - High-High (H-H): districts with high values surrounded by other
    high-value districts.
  - Low-Low (L-L): districts with low values surrounded by other
    low-value districts.
  - High-Low (H-L): potential spatial outliers with high values
    surrounded by low-value neighbors.
  - Low-High (L-H): potential spatial outliers with low values
    surrounded by high-value neighbors.

The resulting LISA cluster map highlights where economic activities are
concentrated and where they are sparse relative to neighboring areas.

### Data prep

``` r
# Load 2020 boundaries
sf_2020 <- load_districts(year = 2020)

# Load 2020 economy data
df_2020_economy <- anycensus(year = 2020,
                             type = "economy")

# Merge with spatial data
sf_2020_economy <- sf_2020 |>
  inner_join(df_2020_economy, by = "adm2_code") 

# Variable of interest: number of companies
var <- sf_2020_economy$company_total_cnt
```

### Global Moran’s I

``` r
# Build neighbors (queen contiguity) and spatial weights
nb <- poly2nb(sf_2020_economy, queen = TRUE)
lw <- nb2listw(nb, style = "W", zero.policy = TRUE)

# Global Moran's I test
global_moran <- moran.test(var, lw, zero.policy = TRUE)
global_moran
```

    ## 
    ##  Moran I test under randomisation
    ## 
    ## data:  var  
    ## weights: lw  
    ## n reduced by no-neighbour observations  
    ## 
    ## Moran I statistic standard deviate = 10.35, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: greater
    ## sample estimates:
    ## Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance 
    ##       0.424571643      -0.004149378       0.001715960

### Local Moran’s *I* and LISA map

``` r
# Local Moran's I
local_moran <- localmoran(var, lw, zero.policy = TRUE)

# Bind results back to sf object
sf_2020_economy <- sf_2020_economy |>
  mutate(
    Ii   = local_moran[, "Ii"],
    pval = local_moran[, "Pr(z != E(Ii))"]
  )

mean_var <- mean(var, na.rm = TRUE)

sf_2020_economy <- sf_2020_economy |>
  mutate(
    cluster = case_when(
      var > mean_var & Ii > 0 & pval <= 0.05 ~ "High-High",
      var < mean_var & Ii > 0 & pval <= 0.05 ~ "Low-Low",
      var > mean_var & Ii < 0 & pval <= 0.05 ~ "High-Low",
      var < mean_var & Ii < 0 & pval <= 0.05 ~ "Low-High",
      TRUE ~ "Not significant"
    )
  )

ggplot(sf_2020_economy) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = cluster), color = "grey70", size = 0.05) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "High-High"     = "red",
      "Low-Low"       = "blue",
      "High-Low"      = "pink",
      "Low-High"      = "lightblue",
      "Not significant" = "white"
    )
  ) +
  labs(title = "LISA Cluster Map of Company units (2020)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The results reveal a strong metropolitan concentration of economic
activity. High-High (H-H) clusters are predominantly located in the
Seoul Metropolitan Area, reflecting its central role in South Korea’s
economy. Low-Low (L-L) clusters appear in Gangwon Province and along the
borders of Jeollabuk-do, Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and
Chungcheongnam-do, indicating regions with consistently low levels of
company presence. This spatial pattern highlights the dominance of the
capital region in economic activity and the relative sparsity of
industrial and business units in peripheral provinces.
